# Hosting Terms of Service

1. ### Parties

    1.  This agreement is between Ixxy Ltd, a company
        registered in England and Wales under number 07805732, trading as
        "Ixxy", and the organisation or person specified on the order
        summary accompanying this document.

2. ### Definitions

    Hosting
    :	The software and hardware platform, on which Ixxy will host your website.

    Staging Environment
    :   A Staging Environment is a private copy of your live website, which
        can be used to test changes or new content in private before making
        changes to your publicly available live website.

    Support Ticket
    :   A Support Ticket is a task, either logged on the agreed project 
        management system or by sending an email to ixxy.co.uk, which will 
        be assigned to a member of staff at Ixxy for their attention or action.

    Time Allowance
    :   The Time Allowance is a quantity of time allocated for use in
        providing services under this contract.

3. ### The service

    1.  Ixxy will provide the following as part of this contract:

        1.  A hosting service which makes your site available
            for access over the internet;
        2.  Backups and backup restoration;
        3.  Storage and deployment of your website's source code;
        4.  A separate Staging Environment;
        5.  Availability monitoring and response;
        6.  Operating system and infrastructure upgrades and maintenance;

    3.  Unless otherwise agreed, Ixxy will not, under this contract, provide any
        service not specified in clause 3.1 unless it is specified
        in the Proposal, including but not limited to:

        1.  Support for any third-party services upon which your
            service relies;
        2.  Changes to your website which constitute new functionality;

    2.  You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
        something that can reasonably be avoided.

    3.  Nonetheless, Ixxy will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
        your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time.

    4.  If despite Ixxy's reasonable efforts your website becomes unavailable,
        Ixxy will refund or waive the infrastructure fees for any period of
        unavailability longer than one hour.

4. ### Enhancement of the service

    1.  Ixxy may at any time make changes to the Hosting without giving
        notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
        which may have an impact upon your use of your site.

    2.  Ixxy will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
        supply of the services described in clauses 3.1 of this contract.

    3.  Changes made by Ixxy under this clause 4 will normally have no detectable
        effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
        to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
        out of any change we have made to the Hosting or your site, we will make reasonable efforts
        to fix the reported problem.

5. ### Time allowance

    2.  Ixxy will track time spent providing the services specified in this
        contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
        of the time required to service your website in any given month.

    3.  In any given month, Ixxy will carry out all of the services provided
        under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
        Allowance has not been exceeded.

    4.  In any given month, if Ixxy chooses to complete work in excess of the
        Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
        completed at Ixxy's absolute discretion and the fact that Ixxy does 
        so on one occasion will not imply that Ixxy will do so on subsequent
        occasions.

    4.  In any given month, if Ixxy chooses not to complete work in excess of
        the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
        will complete that work if Ixxy's fees for the additional work are paid.
        Ixxy will not complete any such work without your authorisation.

    6.  The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
        change to Ixxy's fees.

    7.  Ixxy will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
        to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
        to a professional standard.

    8.  If your Time Allowance is regularly exceeded, or almost exceeded, Ixxy
        may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
        Allowance be increased.

    9.  If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, Ixxy may require
        you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
        submitting fewer Support Tickets.

    10. Ixxy may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
        to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.

6. ### Suspension

    1.  Ixxy may suspend the services provided as part of this agreement if:

        1.  You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
            to our total fee for the preceding two months' Hosting;
        2.  As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
            protect your data, another Hosting user's information security, or to
            protect other users of the internet.

    2.  In the event that the services are suspended, Ixxy will replace your
        website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.

8. ### Termination

    1.  This contract is subject to a minimum term of 1 month from the date it
    is agreed.

    2.  You may terminate this contract at any time by giving us 30 days' notice
    in writing.

    4.  Ixxy may terminate this contract without notice if you are in material
    breach.

    5.  At the end of this contract, Ixxy will issue a final invoice for your
    usage of Hosting up to the date of termination, which you shall pay.


7. ### Required Materials

    1.  In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
        Required Materials that you must provide.
    2.  You must provide Required Materials as soon as is reasonably
        practical.
    3.  If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
        Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.

8. ### Quality

    1.  Ixxy will deliver work of a professional standard.
    2.  Ixxy is insured against professional negligence to a value of
        Â£1,000,000 (the "insured sum"). Ixxy would be willing to negotiate
        an increase in the insured sum on condition that we were able to
        pass on any corresponding increase in the premium.

9. ### Limitation of liability

    1.  Ixxy cannot guarantee perfect reliability.
    2.  Ixxy will deliver work that is as robust and reliable as is
        reasonably practical.
    3.  You acknowledge that all software of non-trivial size contains bugs,
        including security vulnerabilities, and that it is not
        reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.
    4.  Ixxy will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
        that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
        failure of the Product.
    5.  You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
        in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
        any such failure. Ixxy can work with you to design or implement
        such measures at your request for an agreed fee.
    6.  Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
        liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.
    7.  In any event, Ixxy's total liability under this agreement is
        limited to the lesser of:

        1. The total cost of the Project.
        2. The insured sum.

10. ### Confidentiality

    1.  Ixxy believe that it is best to be open.
    2.  Ixxy will generally not keep the details of your website
        confidential, including by not limited to:

        1.  The fact that Ixxy has a commercial relationship with you;
        2.  The nature and goals of your website;
        3.  The cost to host your website.

    3.  However, Ixxy do regard the following as confidential:

        1.  The specific content of documents or copy that will be
            published on any of your websites that is not yet publicly
            available, most especially the content of forthcoming
            strategy or policy announcements;
        2.  Personal data Ixxy acquires during the course of hosting your
            website;
        3.  The content or existence of any document you send to us that
            is protectively marked.

    4.  If you have additional confidentiality requirements, you must tell
        us in writing as soon as is reasonably practical.


11. ### Intellectual property in the Hosting

    1.  Except as provided for in clause 12, nothing in this agreement is
        intended to transfer any intellectual property right.

    2.	To the extent that it is able (either through ownership or because it
        is licensed under a licence that permits sublicensing) Ixxy licenses all
        intellectual property rights in the Hosting to you for the sole purpose
        of carrying out this agreement.

    3.	To the extent that it is not able to give the licence in 14.2 above,
        Ixxy has taken reasonable steps to check that all intellectual property
        rights owned by third parties in the Hosting permit Ixxy and you to enter
        into this agreement and for you to operate your website as envisaged under this agreement.

12. ### Intellectual property in your website

    1.  To the extent that you are able, you grant us a sufficient licence over
        any material you supply to us, to allow us to host your website for the
        duration of this agreement.

    2. 	To the extent that you are unable to grant the licence under clause
        11.1 above, you shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that any
        material supplied to us that is affected by third party intellectual
        property rights, may be used as part of the operation of your website
        under this agreement.

    3.	Where, under this agreement, we create works, such as computer programs
        and documentation, that were specifically written for and incorporated
        into your website, then we assign to you (as a future assignment of
        copyright) the copyright in the works, subject to a licence from you to
        Ixxy that allows Ixxy to use the works in the
        course of our business and, in particular, as part of any website we may host.

13. ### Payments

    1.  Fees will be billed each month in arrears.

    3.  Invoices are payable within 14 days.

    4.  Ixxy may charge interest on overdue invoices at 5% over the
        Barclay's Bank base rate.

    5.  You shall make payment by BACS transfer or (if agreed in advance with
        Ixxy) credit or debit card. Ixxy does not accept cheques.

    6.  Credit and debit card payments are subject to a 2.5% fee.

    7.  Ixxy issues invoices by email. If you require a paper invoice to be
        issued, a fee of 2.5% of the value of the invoice (exclusive of VAT)
        shall be payable.

    8.  VAT (where applicable) is payable on, and in addition to, all sums
        due under this agreement.




14. ### Circumstances beyond our control

    1.  Ixxy will not be liable for any failure caused by industrial
        action or other circumstances beyond our reasonable control.

15. ### Changes to these terms

    1.  Ixxy may vary these terms at any time upon giving you prior
        written notice.
    2.  If any proposed change in these terms puts you at a material
        disadvantage you may send us a written objection, in which case,
        the change will not be binding on you.
    3.  Any such written objection must be sent within 14 days of the
        the notice Ixxy sends you.
    4.  This clause does not apply if it would violate the terms of a
        framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part.

16. ### Proper law

    1.  This agreement is governed by English law and the parties agree
        that any disputes arising from the agreement will be subject to
        the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of England and Wales.

17. ### Email
    1.  Any reference to "in writing" includes email and excludes fax
        transmissions.

18. ### Headings

    1.  The section headings contained in this agreement are for
        reference only and shall not in any way affect the meaning or
        interpretation of this agreement.

19. ### Whole agreement

    1.  With the exception of any framework agreement of which this agreement forms a part,
        this Agreement and the order summary that accompanies it constitute the entire
        agreement between us with respect to the Project, and replaces any prior oral or
        written agreement which may exist.
