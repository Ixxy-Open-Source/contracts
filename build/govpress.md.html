        <p>Product Science will provide the following as part of this contract:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>A hosting service which makes your site available
for access over the internet;</li>

        <p>Unless otherwise agreed, Product Science will not, under this contract, provide any

in the Proposal, including but not limited to:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Support for any third-party services upon which your
service relies;</li>
          <li>Changes to your website which constitute new functionality;</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>You agree that occasional unavailability of your website is not
something that can reasonably be avoided.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Nonetheless, Product Science will make every reasonable effort to ensure that
your website is accessible over the internet 100% of the time.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If despite Product Science’s reasonable efforts your website becomes unavailable,
Product Science will refund or waive the infrastructure fees for any period of
unavailability longer than one hour.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="enhancement-of-the-service">Enhancement of the service</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Product Science may at any time make changes to the Hosting without giving
notice. We will inform you as soon as is practical of any change
which may have an impact upon your use of your site.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Product Science will not make any changes that remove or materially impair the
supply of the services described in clauses 4.1 and 4.2 of this contract.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Changes made by Product Science under this clause 5 will normally have no detectable
effect on the operation of your website. If you make a reasonable request
to us to fix a problem with the operation of your website that has arisen
out of any change we have made to the Hosting or your site, we will make reasonable efforts
to fix the reported problem.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h3 id="time-allowance">Time allowance</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p>Product Science will track time spent providing the services specified in this
contract in sufficient detail to be able to provide an approximation
of the time required to service your website in any given month.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, Product Science will carry out all of the services provided
under this contract with no additional fee, provided that the Time
Allowance has not been exceeded.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if Product Science chooses to complete work in excess of the
Time Allowance, no additional fee will be payable. Any such work is
completed at Product Science’s absolute discretion and the fact that Product Science does so on
one occasion will not imply that Product Science will do so on subsequent occasions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In any given month, if Product Science chooses not to complete work in excess of
the Time Allowance, we may notify you, and, subject to our availability,
will complete that work if Product Science’s fees for the additional work are paid.
Product Science will not complete any such work without your authorisation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The Time Allowance may be varied by agreement, and with a corresponding
change to Product Science’s fees.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Product Science will not ordinarily agree to a reduction in the Time Allowance if
to do so would impede our ability to provide services under this agreement
to a professional standard.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If your Time Allowance is reguarly exceeded, or almost exceeded, Product Science
may notify you that this is the case, and request that the Time
Allowance be increased.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If you do not agree to increase the Time Allowance, Product Science may require
you to reduce the workload that your website generates; for example, by
submitting fewer Support Tickets.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Product Science may, for a fee, be able to advise you on alternative approaches
to managing your website that could reduce your operational costs.</p>

  <li>
    <h3 id="suspension">Suspension</h3>

    <ol>

        <ol>
          <li>You fail to pay invoices whose total value is greater than or equal
to our total fee for the preceding two months’ Hosting;</li>
          <li>As a last resort, it is necessary for us to do so in order to
protect your data, another Hosting user’s information security, or to
protect other users of the internet.</li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>In the event that the services are suspended, Product Science will replace your
website with a message stating that your website is down for maintenance.</p>

  <li>
    <h3 id="required-materials">Required Materials</h3>

    <ol>
      <li>In order to resolve Support Tickets, there will occasionally be
Required Materials that you must provide.</li>

practical.</li>
      <li>If work on a Support Ticket cannot take place without Required
Materials, we will suspend work on that ticket.</li>

reasonably practical to deliver bug-free software.</li>
      <li>Product Science will not be liable for any loss of profits or reputation
that you suffer, directly or indirectly, as a consequence of any
failure of the Product.</li>
      <li>You agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that you put
in place measures that make you able to operate in the event of
any such failure. Product Science can work with you to design or implement
such measures at your request for an agreed fee.</li>
      <li>Nothing in this agreement should be read as excluding our
liability for death or personal injury caused by our negligence.</li>
      <li>
        <p>In any event, Product Science’s total liability under this agreement is
limited to the lesser of:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>The total cost of the Project.</li>
          <li>The insured sum.</li>
